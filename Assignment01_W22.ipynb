        "  + After each question, add the needed number of new cells and place your answers inside the cells. \n",
        "  + Use text cells for explanations. Use explanation and plain text as much as possible. \n",
        "  + Do not remove or modify the original cells provided by the instructor.\n",
        "  + In the following cell you will find some extra options to make your code more readable, including output colors RED, OKBLUE, or output text styles like BOLD or UNDERLINE that. Do not hesitate to use them. As an example, one may output text in red as follows: \n",

        "  + In some questions some of the details needed for solving the problem are **purposely** omitted to encourage additional self-directed research. This, especially, helps you develop some search skills for coding in Python (which is inevitable due to the inconsistent syntax of Python).\n",
